# Breast Cancer Machine Learning Project

A machine learning project to detect and classify breast cancer tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project involves:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Building and training machine learning models
- Evaluating model performance

The goal is to create an accurate classifier to help with early breast cancer detection.
